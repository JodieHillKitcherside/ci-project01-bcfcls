### Unfixed / Solved Bugs 
- Logo and h1 in the .header would not display side by side without an imposed margin, the design did not fit well. Instead, the logo and h1 are positioned parralel and central to keep the design fluid independant of the screen size. 
- Hero Image did not suit to cover screen as a background due to the image quality. Instead, the hero image has been set to fill and image rendering; auto. This is a much clear picture.
