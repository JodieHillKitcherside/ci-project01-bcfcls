        <h2><strong>BCFCLS History</strong></h2>
        <br>
        <div id="history-box">
        <br>
        <p>Established in the mid 1970s, Bristol City London Supporters Football Club were founded as a way for Robins fans living in the Capital to meet up and put on the red and white (purple and green) kit to represent the club in the The Association of Provincial Football Supporters' Clubs In London (APFSCiL) league.</p>
        <p>Over the last 4 decades, the club has seen a full turnover of City fans who have all stayed in touch & created a legacy community of supporters young and old who regularly meet to watch Bristol City at home and on the road.</p>
        <p>Since 2021 BCLSFC have been playing their home games at Regents Park in central London, representing the club in the Central London Sunday League under the tenure of manager Jed Begley.</p>
        <p>The club are always open for new players to join, whether you are a red or not, get in touch or head to Regent’s Park at 2pm on a Sunday and come and say hello!</p>

        <p>Match availability required by the Tuesday on the week of the game to ensure that no fine is received from the league. To be entered into the Heja app (this may change to FA Matchday app) once fixtures have been generated.</p>
